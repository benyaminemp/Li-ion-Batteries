# Li-ion-Batteries 🔋

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of models and algorithms developed during my PhD research on lithium-ion battery modelling, parameter estimation, and predictive learning. The goal is to contribute open, reproducible, and well-documented code to the battery research community. More tools and models will be added over time as my research progresses and results are published.

## Projects Included

### 🔹 Single Particle Model (SPM)
A simplified electrochemical model for Li-ion batteries that captures essential charge/discharge dynamics while remaining computationally efficient.

### 🔹 Corrected Single Particle Model (cSPM)
An enhanced version of the SPM with corrections to better handle blended electrodes and specific physics-informed refinements developed as part of my research.

### 🔹 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Battery Prediction
A simple feedforward neural network implementation for battery-related predictive tasks such as state estimation or capacity forecasting.

## 🔄 Upcoming Projects
Additional tools and advanced models will be added after publication of the associated papers. This includes extended electrochemical models and neural network surrogate models

## About Me
👨‍🔬 I hold a PhD in mathematics with a focus on data-driven, empirical and physics-based modelling of lithium-ion batteries. This repository is a part of my commitment to open science and knowledge sharing.

## Getting Started
Each subfolder contains:
- A dedicated `README.md`
- Code (scripts or notebooks)
- Example data or usage instructions

To explore a project:
```bash
cd ProjectName
```
Then follow the instructions in the respective `README.md`.
