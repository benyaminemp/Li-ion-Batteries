# Li-ion-Batteries 🔋

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of models and algorithms developed during my PhD research on lithium-ion battery modeling, parameter estimation, and predictive learning. The goal is to contribute open, reproducible, and well-documented code to the battery research community. More tools and models will be added over time as my research progresses and results are published.

## Projects Included

### 🔹 Single Particle Model (SPM)
A simplified electrochemical model for Li-ion batteries that captures essential charge/discharge dynamics while remaining computationally efficient.

### 🔹 Corrected Single Particle Model (cSPMB)
An enhanced version of the SPM with corrections to better handle blended electrodes and specific physics-informed refinements developed as part of my research.

### 🔹 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Battery Prediction
A simple feedforward neural network implementation for battery-related predictive tasks such as state estimation or capacity forecasting.

## 🔄 Upcoming Projects
Additional tools and advanced models will be added after publication of associated papers. This includes extended electrochemical models and neural network sorrugate models

## About Me
