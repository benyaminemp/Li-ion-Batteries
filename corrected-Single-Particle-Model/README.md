# Corrected Single Particle Model (cSPM) for Li-ion Battery – Cathode Half-Cell

## 🔋 Overview
This repository contains a **corrected Single Particle Model (cSPM)** for a **Li(Ni₀.₄Co₀.₆)O₂ (LNC)** cathode half-cell. The model incorporates **electrolyte dynamics** into the traditional SPM framework and is solved using the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** for both solid-phase and electrolyte equations.

This implementation provides enhanced accuracy over the classical SPM by including:
- Ionic concentration dynamics in the electrolyte
- Electrolyte potential field
- Improved voltage prediction
